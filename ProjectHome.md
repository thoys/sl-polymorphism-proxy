The SL Polymorphism Proxy with Imaginary Friends is an add on for Second Life (http://www.secondlife.com). The product enhances the user experience by providing user control over avatar appearances, and further by allowing the placement of avatars anywhere in the virtual environment. Both of these events occur only to the user running the software.

The product's initial release is still in beta testing. Future enhancements will include support for animating the imaginary friends, saving the local users appearance preferences, possible parental controls, and other as yet undetermined possibilities.

Software development by Thoys Pan and FWord Utorid, and concepts by Jedediah Horenbach and Dirty Mclean.
